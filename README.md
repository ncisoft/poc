# collections for Proof of concept (PoC)

With these POCs, I try to illustrate some ridiculous concepts introduced by some experts of IT industry.
 
## asyncdotnet

Illustrate how to adopt c# async/await Task-based Asynchronous Pattern for asynchronous network programming. you will see a natural & straightforward way with multi thread enhancement.

Therefore my question is what is the unique benefit by introducing Golang?  

## mcsp-service

Illustrate how to adopt multiple consumer single producer pattern to handle resource  competition under multi-thread environment, it's a natural & straightforward way to handle multi-thread competition with traditional PL like c#/Java under multi-cores machines. 

Therefore my question is do we really need to abandon Java/c# to embrace complicated Functional Programming Language like Erlang?
